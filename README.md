Safety maps

Install the node dependencies in both the client and server directories

```
cd ./client
npm install
cd ../server
npm install
```

Running the client
```
cd ./client
npm start
```
Create-react-app takes care of running a dev server

Running the server
```
cd ./server
npm start
```
This runs `node index.js` and will start listening at localhost:3000
